About

The Smart Restaurant AI Chatbot is a modern, AI-powered conversational assistant designed to enhance the dining experience by providing personalized meal suggestions and answering restaurant-related queries. Leveraging Google Gemini AI integrated with LangChain tools, the chatbot intelligently understands user inputs and determines whether to respond conversationally or invoke specialized meal-planning tools for precise recommendations.

Built on a robust Node.js and Express backend, the system delivers fast, reliable responses via REST APIs. The frontend offers a clean, user-friendly chat interface for seamless interaction. Hosted on platforms like Render and GitHub Pages, this project demonstrates practical deployment of AI-driven services on the web.

Key features include breakfast, lunch, and dinner planning, natural language understanding, and tool-augmented decision making to improve accuracy and control. This chatbot is ideal for restaurant automation, customer support, and educational purposes in AI and web development.

Future improvements may add persistent chat memory, user authentication, dynamic menu management, and multi-language support to further enhance usability and scalability.

This project exemplifies the integration of cutting-edge AI models with practical web technologies to deliver intelligent, scalable solutions for real-world applications.
